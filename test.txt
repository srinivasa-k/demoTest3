signal subscribed printers are grouped into collections. collection management is applicable for these printers only. As part of collection management CMS has to move printers into active and inactive profiles. Whenever a printer is moved from active to inactive vice-versa, it impacts server utilization. If server utilization crosses some threshold CMS has to move that Printer to a new server. CMS has to optimally use UDP servers by adding and removing servers dynamically at run time. Server utilization is calculated by the number of active and inactive printers registered to that server.
